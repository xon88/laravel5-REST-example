# laravel5-REST-example

This is a simple REST API created with [Laravel 5.1](https://laravel.com/) to show the basics of how to go about setting up migrations, seeds, routes, controllers, middleware, models, and unit tests. The project does not include any authentication as it was developed as a basic in-house example. It was initially started with the use of Eloquent ORM and Query Builder, which functionality is in-built to the fresh laravel installation, however it was then completely re-factored to avoid the use of ORMs and Query Builders. Therefore, all SQL queries were re-written as raw queries and Models where written from scratch without extending Eloquent's Model.

<br>

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The API was tested on a CentOS 7 VM as a PHP webserver. Laravel 5.1 requires PHP 5.6. Below are all instructions of how to setup this VM from scratch. If you already have an environment setup, the requirements are:
* Apache webserver
* MySQL (MariaDB on CentOS)
* Git
* Composer
* Laravel dependencies
  * PHP 5.6
  * php-mbstring & php-mcrypt

<details><summary> **CLICK HERE for Instructions**</summary>
<p>

* Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* Download [CentOS7 64-bit ISO](https://www.centos.org/download/)

[Youtube instructions for the steps below:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1nF7HQAJGw)
* Create a new Linux RedHat 64-bit VM (default 1GB RAM and 8GB HDD are enough)
* If you do not get an option for 64-bit, you need to enable Virtualization settings from your BIOS
* Start VM and Install CentOS7 as a simple PHP webserver installation
  * Basic Web Server -> Tick PHP Support
  * Choose correct time
  * Setup root password and users
  * Change VM's Network Settings to Bridged Network Connection

<br>

Login as root.

Install php-common:
```
yum install php-common
```

Open Firewall for Apache and register as service:
```
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
firewall-cmd --reload
systemctl enable httpd
```

Install MariaDB and register as service

>Check if installed:
```
rpm -qa | grep mariadb
```
>Install:
```
yum install mariadb-server
systemctl enable mariadb.service
```
Restart VM and login as root again
```
reboot
```

Open my.cnf file in any text editor. Add "skip-grant-tables" (without quotes) at the end of [mysqld] section and save the file
```
vi /etc/my.cnf
    
[mysqld]
skip-grant-tables
```
Enable External connections to the database:
```
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=mysql
firewall-cmd --reload
```

Install php-mysql and update packages:
```
yum -y install php-mysql
yum -y update
```
Install SFTP and enable as service:
```
yum -y install vsftpd

systemctl enable vsftpd

firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=21/tcp
firewall-cmd --reload
```
Creating Virtual Hosts Settings:
```
mkdir /etc/httpd/sites-available
mkdir /etc/httpd/sites-enabled
```
>Open conf file:
```
vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
```
>Put the following at the end of file:
```
IncludeOptional sites-enabled/*.conf
```
>Change
```
Directory /var/www/
...
AllowOverride None
...
/Directory
```
>to
```
Directory /var/www/
...
AllowOverride All
...
/Directory
```
>Save file and exit.

Install git:
```
yum -y install git-all
```

Install Composer Globally:
```
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```

Install Laravel Dependencies:

>ext-mbstring:
```
yum -y install php-mbstring
```
>ext-mcrypt
```
yum -y install epel-release
yum -y install php-mcrypt*
```

Update to PHP 5.6:
>CentOS7 comes with PHP 5.4 by default, but Laravel 5.1 requires at least PHP 5.6
```
yum install https://centos7.iuscommunity.org/ius-release.rpm
yum install yum-plugin-replace
yum replace --replace-with php56u php
```

### Installation

**Assumptions:**
* Prerequisites above are met
* You have a CentOS machine (some of the following commands are CentOS-specific)
* You have a <code>sites-available</code> & <code>sites-enabled</code> Apache setup
* The following setup will be used (these can be changed in the commands below according to your needs)
* code will reside under <code>/var/www/dev.local</code>
  * hostname = <code>dev.local</code>
  * new database schema name = <code>mydatabase</code>
  * new database user & password = <code>dbuser / mypassword</code>
  * new linux user = <code>projuser</code>

<br>

Login as root.

Create Database and DB User:
```
mysql

grant all on *.* to ‘dbuser’@’%’ identified by ‘mypassword’ with grant option;

create database mydatabase;
	
quit
```

Create a file for your virtual host in <code>/etc/httpd/sites-available</code>:
```
vi /etc/httpd/sites-available/dev.local.conf

<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName  dev.local
  ServerAlias dev.local
  DocumentRoot /var/www/dev.local/public
  ErrorLog     /var/www/dev.local/logs/error.log
  CustomLog    /var/www/dev.local/logs/requests.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```
>[More Info...](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-apache-virtual-hosts-on-centos-7)

Enable the hosts (symlink):
```
ln -s /etc/httpd/sites-available/dev.local.conf /etc/httpd/sites-enabled/dev.local.conf
```

Create project user:
```
adduser projuser
passwd projuser
```

Make sudoer and add to apache group:
```
usermod -aG wheel projuser
usermod -aG apache projuser
```
>By default, on CentOS, members of the wheel group have sudo privileges.

Create project folder:
```
mkdir /var/www/dev.local
chmod -R 775 /var/www
chown -R projuser:apache /var/www
```

Login as the project user and navigate to the directory:
```
su projuser
cd /var/www/dev.local
```

Make your user the owner:
```
sudo chown -R projuser:apache /var/www/dev.local
```

Make sure directory is empty - if not empty it and also remove hidden files:
```
rm -R /var/www/dev.local/*
rm -R /var/www/dev.local/.*
```

Clone repo - get clone link from github:
>Don't forget the . at the end to clone in current directory without creating a new folder
```
git clone https://github.com/xon88/laravel5-REST-example.git .
```

Turn off git marking files as changed if permissions have changed:
```
git config core.filemode false
git config --global core.filemode false
```

Create required directories:
```
mkdir vendor
mkdir logs
sudo chmod -R 777 storage/
```
>777 is not a good idea here but for dev purposes should be fine


In CentOS, you need to set write permissions in SELinux:
```
su -c "chcon -R -h -t httpd_sys_script_rw_t /var/www/dev.local/storage/"
su -c "chcon -R -h -t httpd_sys_script_rw_t /var/www/dev.local/logs/"
```

Check that all is fine with apache by restarting it:
```
sudo systemctl restart httpd.service
```

Install project dependencies:
```
composer install --no-dev
```

Create .env file
```
sudo cp .env.example .env
```

Clear cache:
```
php artisan cache:clear
composer dump-autoload
```

Make your user the owner and apache as group:
```
sudo chown -R projuser:apache /var/www/dev.local
```

Generate application key:
>Should be written to .env file automatically
```
sudo php artisan key:generate
```

Edit .env file:
```
vi .env

...
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false ##set to true if you need to debug any problems
APP_KEY=[already set by previous command]

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_DATABASE=mydatabase
DB_USERNAME=dbuser
DB_PASSWORD=mypassword
...
```

Migrate and seed db:
```
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
```

Restart Apache:
```
sudo systemctl restart httpd.service
```

Check virtualhosts:
```
httpd -S
```

Note down the machine's IP address:
```
ip addr
```

Add virtual hosts in host file on your host OS
>On windows: <code>C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts</code>
>Edit host file as Administrator and add line:
```
[yourVMsIPaddress] dev.local
```

#### Running Unit Tests (Optional)

Run the tests:
>Running with phpunit version installed in laravel's vendor directory to avoid version problems
```
vendor/bin/phpunit
```
>Wait for tests to complete successfully

Clear test records from database:
>Drop and re-create DB, migrate and seed data again
```
mysql

drop database mydatabase;
create database mydatabase;

quit

php artisan cache:clear
composer dump-autoload

php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
```

## API Specifications

### Task
>Implement a REST API that shall be used internally, so no authentication is needed. Format shall be JSON. No front-end or graphical interface is
needed. Please use any DBAL such as PDO but do not use an ORM or query builder (such as Doctrine or Eloquent).
>
>We need the following functionality/endpoints:
>
>* Add new customer (gender, first name, last name, country, email). Each customer during creation should have assigned a random bonus parameter between 5% and 20%. Email shall be unique.
>* Edit customer details given on registration. For each customer the following operations shall be possible:
>>>* Deposit money. Every 3rd deposit of the customer should be awarded with bonus on the deposit amount according to his bonus parameter. For instance, if a customer with 10% bonus is making a deposit of 100 EUR, his balance shall increase by 110 EUR. Bonus balance needs to be kept separate from real money balance.
>>>* Withdraw money. Customer balance can never go below 0 and bonus money cannot be withdrawn. For instance, if customer balance is
110 EUR, but 10 EUR is bonus money, the maximum withdrawal amount is 100 EUR.
>* Reporting endpoint generating a list of the total deposits and withdrawals (unique customers doing at least one deposit or withdrawal,
number and total amount of both, deposits and withdrawals) per country and date for a given time frame (default: last 7 days).
>>>* Example:
>>>
>>>
>>>| Date       	| Country 	| Unique Customers 	| No of Deposits 	| Total Deposit Amount 	| No of Withdrawals 	| Total Withdrawal Amount 	|

>* Financial operations (deposit/withdrawal) needs to be implemented in a way that ensures data integrity also for situations where different transaction requests are made at the same moment.

<br>

### Implementation
I used Laravel 5.1 for the implementation of this project, with grouped and nested routes, providing RESTful endpoints which return JSON data and correct HTTP status codes for each request. Since I had to avoid the use of Eloquent, I implemented my own ElegantModel class, where I placed all common model functionality, and extended this class for each model I needed. This way, I minimized code duplication and made it as dynamic as possible. I used a middleware to check that the customer exists and load their details, when customer_id needed to be passed in the endpoint URL. I added a parameter in the middleware which locks the customer's row for update when the request is a financial operation, to maintain data integrity. Apart from this, I also implemented an optimistic locking solution for the customer table (version). I did not implement a controller for the countries, for which I seeded all the data.

<br>

### Omissions, vulnerabilities, future enhancements
* No security and authentication was implemented
* Unused extras included with the laravel installation were not cleared
* Currency was not implemented
* Validation is basic and not too much attention was given to SQL sanitization
* Only <code>PUT</code> full row updates were implemented (vs. <code>PATCH</code> = partial update)
* No <code>DELETE</code> endpoints were implemented
* A separate <code>wallet</code> table would have been ideal for storing balances, since only the row in this table would have to be locked for update on financial operations, instead of locking the whole row in the customers table

## Good to know:

If you encounter any problems try disabling SELinux (CentOS). This is not permanent, so they will be reset to default status after reboot, but it will help identify if the problems you are encountering are being caused by SELinux.

>Disable:
```
setenforce 0
```
>Enable:
```
setenforce 1
```


#### Changing IP of the VM (CentOS)
```
sudo dhclient -r
sudo dhclient
```


#### Dropping and migrating a fresh database:
```
su projuser
cd /var/www/dev.local

mysql
drop database mydatabase;
create database mydatabase;
quit

composer dump-autoload
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
```
